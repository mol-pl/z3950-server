Reporting issues
----------------------------------
Note that most MOL team contributions are described in Polish and refer to our internal [Flyspray](http://www.flyspray.org/) installation. We can speak English though, so you can report issues in whatever language you feel comfortable in.

### If you are a MOL client ###
Please use our support requests form in our [Customer zone](http://www.mol.pl/?mol=strefa) (Polish).

### If you are not a MOL client ###
Of course our customers' requests are our top priority, but we will consider requests from other parties, especially if you find a security issue.

Note, however, that we do NOT support request for changing [JZKit](http://www.k-int.com/jzkit) itself. We support  only the requests regarding our fork.

* Non-security issues - use [Github issues](https://github.com/mol-pl/z3950-server/issues/).
* Security issues - report by e-mail: pawel-at-mol.com.pl.

Note that if you are our customer, we prefer that you use our [Customer zone](http://www.mol.pl/?mol=strefa) (Polish). Our customer zone is for any kind of issues (including security issues).
